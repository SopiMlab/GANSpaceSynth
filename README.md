# GANSpaceSynth

GANSpaceSynth combines [GANSpace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02546) with [GANSynth](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1xQVn09FX), using dimensionality reduction (PCA) to organize the latent space of trained GANSynth models and to obtain controls for exploring the range of sounds that can be synthesized.

Also included is Hallu, our composition tool for Pure Data demonstrating the use of GANSpaceSynth to compose audio hallucinations moving through the latent space.
